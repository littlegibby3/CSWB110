        <h2>Building a wordpress site for disc golf !
	</h2>
<a href="index.html">home page</a>

        <main>
Disc golf, a blend of frisbee and traditional golf, is exploding in popularity and I want to create a website to guide new players!
I want to offer guides covering everything from disc types and grips to throwing mechanics and basic course etiquette. I'll add Diagrams and even video demonstrations to break down complex concepts. I'll get deeper into advanced throws, course strategy, and disc selection for specific scenarios. Also, I'll Include content on disc golf etiquette, tournament participation, and building a personal disc bag.  I will also take a look at seasoned players with advanced throwing techniques to  iron out any kinks they may have developed in their form.
I may even create a space for players to ask questions, share experiences, and discuss disc golf news to build a sense of community. I want to allow users to submit reviews and photos of local courses, helping others discover new places to play. I want to list upcoming tournaments, clinics, and disc golf gatherings, keeping players informed and connected.

I'll provide guides to choosing the right discs for different skill levels and playing styles. I want to reach out to the local disc golf shop for potential sponsorship opportunities where players from around the community can get sponsored by coming across my website. It would also be cool to create an interactive map of disc golf courses worldwide, allowing users to search by location. Lastly, I would like to offer fun and effective drills to improve skills.
