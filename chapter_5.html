	The organization that is used for the JavaJam after reviewing chapter 5 that I believe is a hierarchical organization and being the most appropriate being the home page having the most importance and branching off to the music, menu, and jobs.But for are own website where we post are list of chapters in order for you to view, that may be more of a linear organization having our main home page then chapter 1,2,3 etc. 

Three design practices that have been well implemented are the first one I feel is really important for any web site is the navigation bar. The navigation bar is clear and consistent to go through and is easy to navigate for the user to find out more about Javajam coffee house. The main navigation uses images that  give that backcountry coffee nostalgia to the website. All the hyperlinks in the nav bar work so the user doesn’t get frustrated. Also, the navigation bar is easy to use for the audience.
The second one would be the color and graphics of the website. The colors in that website have that mocha coffee look to it with the yellowish for the background and the heads being brown. The images in the hyperlinks blend right in for example; having  the mugs in the menu setting the tone showing a clear example. 
Lastly, the third web design that was well implemented the browser compatibility which is really no surprise but I really enjoyed looking at the progress in different web browsers 

Three web design practices that I believe could improve are the layout but right now the website is so small still and only being chapter five I believe the website is only going to grow. For example the jobs hyperlink isn’t even set up which tells me that I will be working on that later in the textbook. With that being said maybe create those hyperlinks from the beginning and add css as the book comes along. 

Other ways that I would improve the website would be adding more images and adding on to the css. I would also add different colors but leaving the same ones just adding more where it counts. Like I stated before, I would add on the hyperlink for the jobs and just have it there from the beginning.
